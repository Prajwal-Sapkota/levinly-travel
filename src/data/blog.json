        "introduction": "Boudhanath Stupa is situated at Boudha, a culturally diverse neighbourhood in the northeastern part of Kathmandu, Nepal. It is located about 7 kilometres northeast of Thamel, the city's popular tourist hub. One of the most renowned and spiritually charged places in Nepal, Boudhanath Stupa rises gracefully above the Kathmandu Valley as a sign of wisdom, compassion, and the order of the universe. Having outstanding universal value as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is a sacred destination, meditation, and cultural diversity, especially for practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism.",
        "heritage": "The source of Boudhanath traces back to the 5th century CE, throughout Ucchavi time, although legends suggest the possibility of an even earlier foundation. According to the traditional story, the stupa was assigned by a humble woman named Ma Jhyalima, who put in a plea for land from the king to build a shrine for a Buddha's remains.",

        "rituals": "Daily, a large number of pilgrims and devotees come to perform kora—ritual circumambulation (pradakshina) of the stupa in a clockwise direction. The rhythmic rotation of the prayer wheels, the chanting of mantras (mainly 'Om Mani Padme Hum'), and the offering of butter lamps and incense are central to the spiritual ambience.",
