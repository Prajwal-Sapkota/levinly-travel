        "introduction": "Pashupatinath doesn't let you be a spectator. Whether you want to or not, you become part of it—the smoke from funeral pyres settles on your clothes, the chants enter your thoughts, the river's flow becomes your heartbeat.",

            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "I came expecting a temple. I found a universe. Cremations upstream. Bathing pilgrims downstream. Priests performing intricate rituals. Sadhus holding court. Tourists trying to understand. Locals going about their daily worship."

            "content": "As the sun set, priests began the evening ceremony. Bells rang, lamps were lit, chants rose. The sacred wasn't abstract. It was in the flame, the sound, the collective breath of hundreds of devotees."

        "conclusion": "I left Pashupatinath with soot on my shoes and peace in my heart. The temple hadn't just shown me spirituality. It had shown me that spirituality isn't separate from life—it's life, fully lived, fully honored."
